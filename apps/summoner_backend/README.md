# SummonerBackend

Service to parse /r/summonerschool threads and comments based on tags (i.e. champion (ziggs, ahri), lane (jungle, mid), season, and so on) for generating notifications

Original idea started off from the other summonerschool project I had, but that was a dud and I stopped working on it. Picked it back up with Elixir for learning purposes.
